# Todo Website

I created this project using the Angular Framework, and Typescript as the front-end programming language. I used Tailwind CSS for styling the webpage. 

## Features

 - Create task categories dynamically by clicking the + button at the top of the website
 - Expand and collapse task categories by clicking the + or - button next to the task category
 - Edit a task category by clicking the pen icon at the top of the website and the pen icon next to the task category to edit
 - Delete a task category by clicking the pen icon at the top
 - Create and fulfill tasks dynamically by clicking the + Todo button at thew end of each task category with the following options:
		- 'Date': Consists of options for each day, date, month and year after the current date
   		- 'Start Time': Consists of options for each hour and 5-minute-intervals in every hour after the current hour
   		- 'End Time': Consists of options for time after setting Start Time
   		- 'Repeat': Tells the program to repeat the task if necessary, every day, week or month (This will be reflected in the schedule calendar)
 - Drag task categories and tasks along the vertical axis using the associated drag icon 
 - View all pending tasks with specified starting times in the schedule calendar
 - Use the right and left arrows at the top of the website to switch between consecutive weeks

## Anticipated Updates

 - Allow tasks in the schedule container to be dragged and placed anywhere on the calendar
 - Create a Node JS backend server with a login portal to save user data using MongoDB
